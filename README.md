# Asteroids - Bradley Crusco

My first independent Unity project, this repository is a remake of the Atari classic for PC written in C#. The game includes everything you'd expect from an Asteroids game: increasingly challenging levels, asteroids that crumble into smaller rocks, wrap-around-screen navigation, leaderboards, etc. There are some added modern tweaks as well, including multiplies that increase the rate of your score increases as you collect more, and UFO enemies that fire at the player and compete to destroy the limited number of asteroids on the screen.
